# Pizza Sales Analytics – SQL + Power BI Project

##  Overview
This is an end-to-end **Data Analytics Portfolio Project** where I analyze pizza sales data using **MS SQL Server** for data processing and **Power BI** for dashboard creation.  
The goal is to extract insights such as **sales performance, trends, and best/worst selling pizzas**, and present them in an **interactive Power BI dashboard**.


##  Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – Data extraction, transformation, and KPI calculation
- **MS SQL Server** – Database management
- **Power BI** – Data visualization & dashboard creation
- **Excel** – Data inspection and CSV preparation

##  Dataset
- **Source**: Pizza sales dataset (2015)
- **Rows**: ~48,000
- **Columns**:  
  - Pizza ID  
  - Order ID  
  - Quantity  
  - Order Date  
  - Order Time  
  - Unit Price  
  - Total Price

##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Total Revenue** – Sum of total price of all pizzas sold  
2. **Average Order Value** – Total revenue / total number of orders  
3. **Total Pizzas Sold** – Sum of all quantities sold  
4. **Total Orders** – Count of distinct orders  
5. **Average Pizzas per Order** – Total pizzas sold / total orders
